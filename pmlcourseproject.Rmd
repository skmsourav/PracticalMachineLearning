# Practical Machine Learning - Course Project

## Introduction
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

## Loading the packages and data
```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
if(!file.exists("pml-training.csv")){download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", destfile = "pml-training.csv")}

if(!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")){download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", destfile = "pml-testing.csv")}

training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","",'#DIV/0!'))
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, na.strings = c("NA","",'#DIV/0!'))
```

Partitioning the training set into two

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]
myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

## Cleaning the data
Remove NearZeroVariance variables

```{r}
nzv <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTraining <- myTraining[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]

nzv<- nearZeroVar(myTesting,saveMetrics=TRUE)
myTesting <- myTesting[,nzv$nzv==FALSE]
```

Remove first column of myTraining dataset

```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
```

Clean variables with more than 60% NA

```{r}
trainingV3 <- myTraining
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) {
    if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .7) {
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) == 1)  {
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j]
            }   
        } 
    }
}

# Set back to the original variable name
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
```

Transform the myTesting and testing data sets

```{r}
clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58])  # remove the classe column
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]         # allow only variables in myTesting that are also in myTraining
testing <- testing[clean2]             # allow only variables in testing that are also in myTraining

dim(myTesting); dim(testing)
```

Coerce the data into the same type

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
    for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) == 1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}

# To get the same class between testing and myTraining
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing)
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

## Prediction with decision trees

```{r}
set.seed(1)
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)

predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")
cmtree <- confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, myTesting$classe)
cmtree

plot(cmtree$table, col = cmtree$byClass, main = paste("Decision Tree Confusion Matrix: Accuracy =", round(cmtree$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```

## Prediction with Random Forests

```{r}
set.seed(1)
modFitB1 <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=myTraining)
predictionB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")
cmrf <- confusionMatrix(predictionB1, myTesting$classe)
cmrf

plot(modFitB1)

plot(cmrf$table, col = cmtree$byClass, main = paste("Random Forest Confusion Matrix: Accuracy =", round(cmrf$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```

## Prediction with Generalized Boosted Regression

```{r}
set.seed(1)
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 1)

gbmFit1 <- train(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method = "gbm", trControl = fitControl, verbose = FALSE)


gbmFinMod1 <- gbmFit1$finalModel

gbmPredTest <- predict(gbmFit1, newdata=myTesting)
gbmAccuracyTest <- confusionMatrix(gbmPredTest, myTesting$classe)
gbmAccuracyTest

plot(gbmFit1, ylim=c(0.9, 1))
```

## Predicting Results on the Test Data

Random Forests gave an Accuracy in the myTesting dataset of 99.89%, which was more accurate that what I got from the Decision Trees or GBM. The expected out-of-sample error is 100-99.89 = 0.11%.

```{r}
predictionB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
predictionB2
```

```{r}
# Write the results to a text file for submission
pml_write_files = function(x){
    n = length(x)
    for(i in 1:n){
        filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
        write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
    }
}

pml_write_files(predictionB2)
```
